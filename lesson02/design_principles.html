           This website is too easy to navigate, since its content is concise, on its main page you find what you need at a glance. This page is effective thanks to the good use of repetition, if you see the red boxes you can realize that everything in the red boxes is about vaccination, and in the blue boxes, you can find other information that is not related to vaccinations. There is repetition in the colors, in the font, and in the grid. We can even see repetition in the images because in each photo we can see that there are two people.

          <h2>WHITE SPACE</h2>
          <h3>ZARA</h3>

          <p>
            This website applies the principle of white space very well, which makes the page look more sophisticated by making good use of padding. White space does not mean "boring" I love that on this page there is even a little contrast to the black and yellow color "SALE" which makes white space attractive, organized, and very trendy which I think is the purpose. of this page, Zara's page, in general, uses white space to counteract with the colors and highlights that stand out in other parts of the page.

          <h2>CONTRAST</h2>
          <h3>&PIZZA</h3>

          <p>
         On this website, we can notice the contrast in the colors, the predominant color throughout the page is black, and its contrast is very good with the light blue icons and buttons, and with the white font. There is also contrast in the font sizes and design, and the combination of colors that the pizza has makes the contrast of this website more noticeable.
